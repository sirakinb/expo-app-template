# Welcome to jack's Expo React Native free boilerplate ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) template project with Superwall libraries ready to use and a simple onboarding sequence for first time users.

This free boilerplate is sponsored by [post bridge](https://post-bridge.com) - a super simple and affordable social media scheduling tool for small teams and founders.

## Get started

1. Clone this repository 

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
Or 

  ```bash
   npx expo install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
-- you will need to make a development build or run in development mode as Superwall does not work in Expo GO

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
